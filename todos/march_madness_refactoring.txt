    managed_by_user

make scoring_system model

cache regions like caching season/games?  is there a need?

in url, season_id -> season/year, etc.
or have a season select like a study select in hms.  then there wouldn't be a need to have season_id in url.

season.tournament_year column can go. just use tournament_starts_at.year.

  show spinner instead of pulsating
  just update, no grow effect
