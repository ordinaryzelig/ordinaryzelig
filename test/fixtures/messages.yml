  body: you've seen them, but do you really appreciate them?  the <a href=http://whiteboard.ups.com/>ups whiteboard commercials</a> are amazing, particularly the 2 on delivery intercept, freight, and accessibility.  my favorite is the one about accessibility.  the man turns a frickin keyboard into a parking lot.  brilliant.

    <p>unlv just beat georgia tech, a 7 seed over a 10 seed.  surprisingly, only 2 people <a href="http://ordinaryzelig.org/pool/game_pics/142">picked unlv over georgia tech</a> (that's where the "see all pics" link takes you in the brackets).  and those 2 people are now in first place.</p>
    
    <p>i have a feeling the games tonight will be more exciting and topsy-turvy since we didn't get much of that last night.  either way, we now have a tournament without duke or gonzaga, so that's nice.</p>

  body: george mason was THIS close to being in the tournament again this year.  i would like to point out that cece had ohio state losing to george mason last year in the <a href="http://ordinaryzelig.org/pool/brackets/31?bracket_num=1&region_order=1&season_id=2">final four</a>.  so no george mason standing in the way may mean trouble for everybody.  it looks like there are some damn cute mascots that are highly ranked!  forget florida repeating.  the only repeat this year is going to be by the prophet.

    <p>how would you like your state represented on the new quarter?  <a href="http://www.ok.gov/governor/coin.php">vote</a> or <a href="http://images.southparkstudios.com/media/images/808/808_img_07.jpg">die, MF</a>.</p>
    
    <p>you have your choice of a gay bird, gigantic hash pipe, or a woman and a child next to an erect structure spewing stuff.  i'm going with hash pipe.  specifically, i opted for the one that doesn't have oklahoma upstaged by the hash pipe.  we're not just about our weed.  we have other things to do like...umm...like...damn.  football!  we oklahomans love us some foosball.  OR...how about a picture of 2 million smiling republicans raising their hands while standing on native americans, and 3 million democrats sitting on their ass doing nothing, and then a picture of a chinaman, me, mooning all of them (not the natives) while drinking matzah ball soup.  viva las oklahoma diverso.</p>

    <p>i have no more pics left.  this season didn't have as many upsets as last year.  yes, last year set the bar high, but for this kind of season, it's surprising how even keel it has been.  at any rate...</p>
    <p>congratulations, caroline.  you are the only player with all final 4 pics correct.  except you picked florida to win it all, so boooo!</p>
    <p>sorry, allaire.  you are the only player with no final 4 pics.</p>
    <p>nguyen, you may get your money back for the 2nd time in 3 years.  good luck!</p>
    <p>even though it's over for me, i think this final 4 is going to be really good to watch.  gtown vs osu looks like a good matchup.  and i'll definitely enjoy watching anybody beat florida.</p>

    <p>i added blogs with ajaxy comments.  only your friends can read your blogs.  there are no friend requests in oz.  just friends.  but like in the real world, you can be someone's friend, but that doesn't mean they consider you their friend.</p>
    
    <p>to add a friend, just go their profile (you can search for them in the sidebar) and click the ajaxy link.  this is the extent to security in oz for the time being.  currently, you have to consider someone your friend before they can see just about anything of yours (not much right now, just your blogs or your other friends).  i'll add more powerful and specific security features later.</p>

    <p>i'm sure what will be going through sanjaya's mind when he eventually gets voted off is what it would be like if he were being judged on different criteria other than the criteria he's actually being judged on -- singing.  fortunately, in oz, you can.  you can see how well your bracket would've done if we were using scoring systems of some other sites.  go to the <a href="http://ordinaryzelig.org/pool/standings">standings</a>, change the scoring system, and dream on.  (if you know of any scoring systems that you'd like to simulate, let me know.)</p>
    
    <p>now that you've seen the results, i'd like to present the very first annual sanjaya malakar award to john meyer, aka JoJoMe.  yes, you did well in the other systems, but they don't count.  maybe next year the sanjaya award recipient will get their money back.  but probably not.  congratulations.  it's ironic that you won this award when it clearly should've gone to stephanie, but hey, we're obviously not judging on hair.  and before you give me the william hung award, i'd like to say that that is just mean and racist.</p>
    
    <p>my scoring system obviously rewards players who correctly pick upsets if they happen.  someone asked me to see how a bracket would do if it were composed of only upsets (naturally this request came from a person who was at the bottom of the standings 2 years in a row), so i did.</p>
    
    <p>this year, all upsets would result in only 5 correct pics, all in the first round, totalling only 49 points.  but this year upsets were sparse.</p>
    
    <p>last year, however, picking all upsets would result in 10 correct pics totalling 128 points.  the only upset that wasn't in the first round was bradley.  interestingly enough, picking all upsets wouldn't have even gotten last place:  2 people did worse than that.  what's funny is that the <strong style="font-size: 125%;">adler women</strong> were those 2.  yes, this year paints quite a different picture, but theoretically, if someone had picked only upsets in the first round, picked bradley, and then just quit, that would have been enough to beat the adler women.  almost as embarrassing as getting beat by them, ever.</p>
    
    <p>i'm open to discussion on scoring systems, suggestions, criticisms, etc.  as a cubs fan, i've already started thinking about next year.</p>
    
    <h2>thanks for playing everybody.</h2>
