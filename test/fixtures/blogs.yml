    <p>after getting used to beijing a little bit, i finally got to see a little bit of what i came to see.  my connection Tong was going to take around and see what she does for a living.  my host mom drove me there in the morning.  on the way there, we passed by this neighborhood.  she called it something in chinese and i didn't understand what it was.  she explained that people around her carry guns.  ahhh, the ghetto.  glad i'm not living here.  15 seconds later, "here we are."  great, i'm going to be working in the middle of the ghetto.  i'm going to get mugged every day.</p>
    
    <p>Tong works for the chinese army.  they're not allowed to take american interns.  i wondered if anybody would suspect something if i came here everyday.  apparently i'll be working somewhere else.  Tong took me to one of her offices and showed me what she does.  she's a sound person.  she puts voices in the right place and puts sound effects in movies and tv shows.  she took me to the editing room where this lady was editing a movie on the computer.  looked interesting.  i figure that's part of what i'll be doing.</p>
    
    <p>the most exciting part was when she took me to an actual sound stage.  an actual set where they were in the middle of filming a chinese opera for television.  it was cool.  i got to see a real shoot.  the best part was that i really felt in place.  i can't wait to make movies.</p>

    <p>so I'm in manhattan right now. coolest city I know. and how many iPhones have I seen? ZERO. not only that, I get ooos and aaahhhs left and right. all these rich people and business people and not a single iphone. am I missing something? or have I put enyce on a pedestal this whole time?<p>
    
    <p>I think I've figured out new yorkers. so stereotypically you think of impatient people. why is that? well, let me make an analogy. how much different are new yorkers than your IT guy? seriously, picture your IT guy and take away the nerd factor. what do you have? a new yorker. we IT people have trouble relating to the people that we support because what we're trying to fix is so terribly obvious to us and we don't have the patience to jackhammer it into their heads because we have better things to do. and i don't mean to sound condascending nor do I condone it. I'm just trying to give you a glimpse of our thought process, difficult as it is to accept.  <p>
    
    <p>so back to new yorkers. new yorkers go through repetition. take bus M60 to Lexington and 86 subway stop, transfer at times square, take B train.... there's also the unwritten rule of courtesy that you be efficient so you don't slow people down. you do this everyday and you start developing what you think is an expertise on, well, everything. and when someone else challenges or tests that, like, say, a tourist, you develop an attitude. et voila, a new yorker. I think I'm ready to move here.<p>

    summer of 2002
    
    <p>so i wanted to go to the art museum.  asked hostmom how to get there.  "it's real easy," she says.  "you can take the bus.  there's a bus stop right in front of the museum and you don't even have to change buses."  nice.  she gives me directions.  next day, i get up all ready to go.</p>
    
    <p>there's several different kinds of buses in beijing.  the nicest ones look like the buses you would imagine in africa.  dirty, beat up, emit large amounts of smoke, make weird noises, no a/c, wobbly, squeaky, etc.  every time the driver stops, the engine dies.  no, seriously, they have to restart the engine before they can move again.  they have all different kinds of lines and you have to find the right number to get to where you want.  when you get on, they don't have the little thingy where you drop in your coins.  they have a special person that goes around and collects cash and gives you a paper ticket.  actually, you just give her cash when you feel like it.  once in a while she'll go around the bus to check to see if everybody has a ticket.  and when you get off, you're supposed to show her your ticket.  i'm sure you can imagine how easy it would be to get a free ride.</p>
    
    <p>so i'm supposed to take the 103.  half an hour's ride if there isn't any traffic.  hostmom told me to ask the ticket lady to tell me when to get off.  i figure i'd just ask her after about 20 minutes.  well, 15 minutes later, we stop at a very dirty place and a surprisingly large amount of people get off.  no, make that everybody is getting off.  i look around.  umm, i don't see an art museum.  but ok.  get off and the bus starts to drive away.  but then i see it stop a few feet from where it kicked all of us off.  people are starting to get on.  was this a ploy to get me off the bus?  did i do something wrong?  i hear somebody say something about a u-turn.  i think i went the wrong way (surprise surprise).  i think i'm at the end of the line.  hmm, if i get on, i'll look like an idiot to the ticket lady.  "heh heh heh, funny lookin american is lost, heh heh heh."  i think i'll wait for the next one thank you.</p>
    
    <p>103.  that's me.  not many people on this bus.  i ask the ticket lady if it goes to the art museum but she doesn't answer me.  she's talking to these three ladies sitting outside.  i ask her again and again, and she doesn't even acknowledge me.  finally she looks up at me with a weird face.  she says something i can't understand and her and the three ladies outside start laughing.  mkay, i think i'll just sit down now.  maybe i should just get off and get a taxi.  nah, he'll probably take me to the great wall and charge me a billion rmb (about $10 us).  bus only costs a buck.  i ask the ticket lady again if she could warn me when we get close to the art museum.  she ignores me again with a smile on her face.  and then she helps this old lady with a kid find a seat.  thanks lady, what service.  we get to an intersection and the bus stops because a stupid car has eeked it's way through the intersection and the bus can't turn without hitting it.  mean ticket lady runs over to my window and practically lays on me to look out the window.  excuse me, lost american sitting down here, can i have some air now?  i think she did it on purpose.</p>
    
    <p>let's see, since it took me 15 minutes to get lost (that's actually pretty good for me), and it takes 30 minutes to get to the art museum going the right way, then i'll ride the bus this way for 45 minutes and i should be there in no time...</p>
    
    <p>...hour and a half later, i hear the recording say something that resembled the art museum.  i get up and walk towards the door.  it opens and i look around but see no art museum.  well, it's probably around here somewhere, i'll just get -- ok nevermind.  door closes and bus starts moving again.  get off at the next stop on impulse.  i'm so lost.  i ask around if anybody knows where the art museum is.  keep on cruisin.  wangfu hotel.  hey, this is where i stayed 10 years ago.  now i can just call my dad and ask him to pick me up.  keep on cruisin.  art museum!  woohoo!  let's see, entrance, entrance, entrance.  hey, there's an opening over there.  heart starts pumpin, i'm gettin excited.  turn the corner.  hard hats.  hard hats everywhere.  why is everyone wearing hard hats?  and why is there scaffolding around the building?  is this supposed to be artistic?  son of a...!</p>
    
    <p>heart in my shoes, i walk back to the bus stop that i missed the first time.  bunches of people.  i'm going to get robbed on the bus.  but i don't care, i'm going home.  "everybody scoot in!" ticket lady shouts.  nobody moves, of course.  people, i'm going home on this bus whether you like it or not.  nobody moves.  fine, i'll just stand on the steps.  grab a hold of a rail.  whoosh!</p>
    
    <p>son of a...!  door slams shut taking my arm along with it.  the rail that i grabbed was part of the door.  i almost stumbled down, if it's possible to stumble down two steps.  "door closing!"  oh, gee, thanks for the warning, ticket lady.  here's your stupid dollar.  you know what, have two dollars, take your kids to the art museum.</p>
    
    <p>so i'm standing in the well of the bus holding on to dear life since nobody will move.  i bet if the door flings open, i'll get squashed like a cartoon.</p>
    
    <p>that's it.  i squeeze my way through some sweaty people and find a spot.  bus stops and about another thousand people get on.  ok, can't breathe.  hey now, i don't know you, get off me please.  and, dude, i hope you're enjoying my armpit.  probably the first time you've smelled deodorant huh?</p>
    
    <p>finally get to my stop, first time i got it right all day.  my arms feel like they're down at my ankles from holding on so tight to the rail.  get home and tell hostmom my story.  so that's my art museum episode even though there really was no art museum.  at least i only spent two bucks.  well, three hours and 2 bucks.  the end.  miss you guys!</p>

    summer of 2002
    
    <p>hey everybody.  long time no see.  guess what?  i'm more than halfway through my trip!  34 more days to go!</p>
    
    <p>no good stories for you lately, sorry.  the best i can do is my little "subway with a gay man" novella.  it's not exactly a full fledged episode.  anyway, so i met this guy today at the place i'm working with my director.  at the start he was very quiet, and i thought he looked a little mean, until i heard him talk...and walk.  overt body movements, limp hand, and all.  i thought to myself.  this man is gay.  well, turns out we ride the same way on the subway to get home (don't take that metaphorically.  i'm not gay, i have a very pretty girlfriend).  we walk to the station and he jumps over a very low chain.  he cleared the chain easily, but it looked like he tripped in midair.  yup, this guy has to be gay.</p>
    
    <p>so we get on the subway and see this lady right next to and facing the door holding her toddler in her arms.  all of a sudden a trickle comes down from the kid.  for future reference, there is no five second rule in china.  you drop it, it's gone.  they end up sitting next to us.  baby lookin right at my gay friend (don't even know his name).  he asks me if i like kids and i told him that oriental kids are particularly cute.  he says that american kids are cute too.  yes yes, lots of fun.  he's gay.</p>
    
    <p>i really do think oriental babies are very cute.  but something happens when they become teenagers.  they just aren't so cute anymore.  Kristin Thomason once asked me, "you used to be cute, what happened?"</p>
    
    <p>on our way to switch lines, he asks me if i think chinese girls are pretty. i don't know why, but i've been asked this question many times.  almost as many times as where my girlfriend is from and why she didn't come with me. anyway, i told him that i didn't think they were that pretty and that American girls are prettier.  and before i met Lina, i was never really attracted to oriental girls.  he said that it's just because i haven't seen any really pretty chinese girls yet.  i think he was just trying to cover up his gayness.  i really want to ask him, but, for one, i don't know how to say gay in chinese, besides, "do you like guys."  second of all, i don't know how the gay scene is in china.  like is it taboo, or against communism, or confucious would never have approved.  i have no idea.</p>
    
    <p>the end.  happy july 4th everybody!  you have to celebrate for me ok?  i'm afraid if i do, i might get arrested.  hostbro said he would take me to the us embassy where they celebrate it, but i'm afraid it will be like a pathetic commercial.  and how much of a dork would i be if i went to the us embassy to celebrate july 4th?  so i'm going to take Kristin's advice and light a match and squint and pretend it's fireworks.  be safe and have fun!  miss you guys!</p>

    summer of 2002
    
    <p>woke up early and was told that we were going to the great wall of china, just the three of us, me and my host parents.  host dad says he's going with us but he's not going to climb the wall.  i figured he just didn't want to do all the walking.  so we drive for more than two hours just to get there.  buy the tickets for me and my host mom and start up a hill.  alright, it's just a little incline, not too bad.  a few steps later, i start dying.</p>
    
    <p>stairs.  hey, i'm at the great of wall of china.  i can make it up some steps.   oh, more steps eh?  alright.  no problem, just a little further.  more?  i have to slow down so i can catch my breath and my thighs can recover from the strain.  you can do it.  start climbing again, thighs start hurting again.   have to stop.  kids start running past me.  my host mom decides to show off and skip steps.  i'm hoping that at the top is heaven, cause i'm about to die here.  they should call it the great staircase.  every once in a while there's a vendor selling film or water.  after about the 10th one i pass, i start asking if they sell oxygen.  i say, "lady, do you see that?  that's a cloud.  i need oxygen right now."  continue to kill myself slowly.  at this point i'm crawling.  old dudes with both hands behind their back walk casually past me.  the great wall was originally built to keep Huns from crossing into their territory.  if i were a Hun, i'd give up too.</p>
    
    <p>finally make it to the top of the mountain (even the signs say mountain). so this is the great wall eh?  i'd been before, but at a different place that wasn't as pretty.  hear a lamb.  look around, nobody seemed to notice.  hear it again.  am i the only one that can hear this?  it starts smelling like a zoo.   look down and see two lambs.  that was all there was at the top.</p>
    
    <p>the way down was the best part.  you can either walk down (or roll down in my case), take the cable car, or slide down.  that's right, slide down.  you sit on these scooter thingies (toboggins, they call them).  push forward on the handle to go faster and pull back to apply brake.  it's just a slide.  it was fun.  in front of me and my host mom were these four american girls.  the third one was kinda scared so she went kinda slow and held some of us up.  but i had chances to go fast.  when we were going slow i started conversing with the girl in front of me.  "so, where you from?"  along the slide there are workers there to make sure you're ok and tell you to go faster or slower.  i asked one of the guys that had a total of three teeth what he was doing for the summer.  he didn't answer.</p>
    
    <p>naturally, at the great wall of china, you're bound to see some foreigners.  this was the first time i had seen people with non-black hair in a long time.   some americans too.  american kids.  i didn't talk to them, but it was nice to see some american kids.  miss you guys.  see you soon.</p>

    <p>today, steve jobs pulled a fast one on us cool kids:  a BIG price drop on the iphone.  the original prices were $500 for 4GB and $600 for 8 GB.  now, there is no 4GB, just the 8GB, and it costs only $400!  ouch.  after a short 2 months on the market, uncle steve cut the price by 33%.</p>
    
    <p>he also unveiled what ipod fans have been intently waiting for: the <a href="http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/wa/RSLID?nnmm=browse&mco=42C0467A&node=home/ipod/ipod_touch">ipod touch</a>.  it looks (and acts) like an even thinner iphone without the phone part, so they only get wifi, no edge wireless.  for the same price as an iphone, you can get a 16GB ipod touch.</p>
    
    <p>i guess you semi cool kid stragglers can tag along with me.  just don't come crying to me when there's no wifi around.  as for you new iphoners...yeah i got nothin.  bitches.  i hate money.</p>

    <p>swimming in a pool with a bunch of chinese.  never thought of such a concept.   i was almost grossed out by the thought of it.  afterall, they don't call it the yellow river for nothing.  just kidding.  so me and Zhang, my step-mom's sister-in-law took me to an indoor swimming pool.  she showed them her card and they punched a hole and gave her a key.  she showed me the signs, "this is the exit, this is the entrance."  i was about to walk in until she took me to the other side where we repeated steps 1-3.  lucky for me we did because i was informed that this side was for boys and the other was for girls.  so Zhang gives me a towel, a swimming cap, some goggles, some soap and some flip-flops and sends me off all by myself.</p>
    
    <p>i go in and see a whole bunch of little kids running around.  so i'm trying to find my locker in this crammed room with screaming little boys -- uh, now there are screaming little naked boys.  i still don't understand that whole slapping of the butt thing.  especially screaming little naked boys' butts.  i still can't find my locker so i walk around some more.  shower room.  didn't need to see that.  finally find my locker and change.</p>
    
    <p>walk out to the olympic sized pool.  i start walking around wondering if i would be swimming by myself too.  guy stops me and asks me if i'm going to swim and i say yes.  "then where's your swimming cap," he says.  "i don't use one," i say.  he retorts, "you have to, it's a rule."  great, jared in a swimming cap.  too bad i didn't see myself in the mirror.  sorry, no pictures.  i find Zhang and we jump in and start swimming.  kinda cold.  swim swim swim.  in march about a thousand little kids.  i was later told that in the fifth grade, everybody has to take swim lessons.  there are adults and littler kids too.  one chubby little girl in a tube decided to come over and say something that i didn't understand and splash some water in my face.  "alright," i said.</p>
    
    <p>we decide to take a break and sit down a bit.  we talked for a while.  she asked me if what i was wearing was made for swimming.  i looked at her kinda funny and said yes.  she said she had never seen swimming suits like mine before.  "really?" i said.  i look around and notice that all the males, old and young, skinny and not so skinny alike, are all wearing speedos.  man, i was glad i brought my own.</p>

    summer of 2002
    
    <p>today, i met Zhang Li, the director who i will be following.  this could be the start of a life-altering career move...</p>
    
    <p>but let's not talk about that right now.  i'd like to talk about the subway for a moment.  i had my first subway experience the other day.  first i think i should tell you, although you probably already know, that chinese people don't use deodorant.  some of you know that i, a chinaman by blood, do no sweat easily.  maybe it's a genetic thing.  i thought about it...no, because my dad can sweat a good one.  well, let me tell you, the people here sweat buckets a day.  chinese people use onion paper rather than the thick stuff we use.  wanna know why?  because they need the other half to wipe off the sweat from their faces.</p>
    
    <p>so my host mom wants to take me to this high-class shopping strip not quite unlike champs elysees in paris.  gotta take the subway to get there.  we walk down about a mile underground.  at the bottom, it's very quiet.  the only sounds are from newspapers swishing around or the occasional high-heel.  finally a breeze blows some skirts up a little and the remaining hairs of a majorly receding hair-line too.  the train runs through with lots and lots of people of which only a few get off.  my host mom and i squeeze our bodies in.  so i'm in a train full of smelly people who don't use deodorant with no fans or a/c where everybody has their arms up holding on to the rails...mmmm.  chinese guys like to do this thing with their t-shirts (if they're wearing one, god willing).  they wad their t-shirts from the bottom as far up as they can go and hold it there with their arms relaxed exposing their bellies.  that's right, stuff cloth up your armpits so it sweats even more.  and being the short person i am, my nose just happens to be at armpit level.  but, jared, you're in china, aren't you considered tall there?  i've observed that there is no difference.  it's just that old chinese people shrivel and shrink more than americans.  if you don't believe me, go find a 70+ chinese person over 5 foot.  they just don't exist.  so when i'm over 70, i'm going to be a smurf.  it's ok when smurfs sweat.  that's where they get that "blue stuff" you see at the mall.</p>

    <p>i wake up at about 1230am with a pain on my right side.  i thought it was just a cramp or something but it got worse.  it started hurting pretty bad so i got up and tried to walk it off.  it wouldn't go away so i woke up Liang, my host mom and we go to the hospital.  not a happy sight.  i saw a doctor after waiting a while.  she said to get a urine sample, so i did.  they analyzed it and found some stuff that shouldn't be in there.  apparently it's like kidney stones.  when you get a whole bunch of it and they come together, they become kidney stones.  i also had to give a blood sample.  they just pricked my finger like they do when you donate blood.  another doctor examined me and said i needed to drink lots of water and come back the next day.  before i left, i had to get a shot in the backside.  earlier that day i got my second hepatitis b shot.  so if you add that with the finger prick, this would make three shots in one day.</p>
    
    <p>i went home and went back to sleep.  woke up early the next morning and went back the next morning to do an ultrasound.  they said that i had to drink a lot of water to expand my bladder and stuff to see clearly.  i drank 1.25 L of sprite.  they didn't find anything.  after waking up i felt better anyway. but i did have a headache from not sleeping well.  hopefully after a goodnight's sleep i'll feel all better tomorrow.</p>

    <p>i first saw this girl on an iphone blog with a <a href="http://www.tastyblogsnack.com/2007/08/13/iphone-bill/">video about a 300 page att bill for the iphone</a>.  at first i thought it was just an actress because she was much too pretty and not nerdy enough to be an iphone user ("everyone's a little bit racist"), but it's real.  she's real.</p>
    
    <p>i went to her <a href="http://www.justineezarik.com/">website</a> and this girl is amazing.  when it comes to communication, to say that she has her shit together would be a huge understatement.  i haven't seen this much know-how in a single person since stuart (don't worry stu, nobody knows as much as you do AND can build an arbor).  this girl does myspace, facebook (mostly through her cell phone), twitter, and loads of other things i've never heard of but feel like i should, cuz what ive seen so far is pretty frickin cool, (e.g. she has <a href="http://www.justin.tv/ijustine">her own, live, 24/7, online, tv channel</a>).</p>
    
    <p>i don't want to jump the gun, but i can EASILY see her overthrowing lily allen as my <a href="http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=78270105&blogID=190872269&Mytoken=540A890E-7285-49B6-975A9FCA9D4FD52199340501">celebrity crush</a> of the year.  "how", you ask, "is that possible"?  <a href="http://www.justineezarik.com/">this</a> is why.  you had me at "i don't even like frosted mini wheats."</p>

    <p>ever wonder where the term spam came from?  go ahead and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_%28electronic%29#History">look it up</a>.  you'll get theories of its history.  but we may never really know the truth, because it wasn't documented.  we're entering a unique time in the technological era where the number of things that are being documented is growing exponentially.  and with the increasing ease of sharing information with the world, it's no wonder, while it's not on any official billboard charts, "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwTZ2xpQwpA">chocolote rain</a>" may in reality be the #1 single in all the land.  but i digress.</p>
    
    <p>recently a family friend discribed to me bbc's amazing mini-series "planet earth".  for the first time, they were able to capture the elusive snow leopard on film.  you're about to witness something similar.  this is comparable to american pie 2 where we get to finally see the band camp we heard so much about.  thankfully, in this day and age of network technology, it's becoming easier and easier to capture moments like these.  anybody can be a photo journalist.</p>
    
    <p>this vlog is of particular interest to me because, to my knowledge, it is the closest documentation of the capture of the elusive birth of a technological term.  it gives you a glimpse into the cultural underground of geekdom, something i'm sure you've seen represented on tv or have at least had some idea.  this, ladies and gentlemen, is podcamp.  at this particular session, the topic of discussion is 'bacn', whose definition you probably knew, but never had a term for.  <a href="http://www.tastyblogsnack.com/2007/08/20/bacn/">here's the definition and the vlog</a>.  enjoy.</p>

  body: I can't help it. everytime I'm able to use my iPhone in an everyday situation, I giggle. I'm at the doctor's office,the receptionist asks me when this certain event happened, and I don't remember. but I do remember that if I had access to my email, I could find out. this makes me happy that I have an iphone and I giggle. I whip out "cool kid" and I go to my email. but I realize it may take a while since I'm not on wifi and I haven't looked at my trash box in a while and it'll take too long to sync. avast (i hope I used that word right), 50 emails to sync. vrooooom. it takes like 2 seconds. apparently cool kid is smart enough to just download the headers and a few lines of the body. including the giggle, it took just a few seconds to get the answer. god this thing is badass. and thanks to a recent text messaging tirade with Stuart, my typing is really fast now. hehehe.
