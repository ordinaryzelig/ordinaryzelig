    comment: i meant them to mean "brand new root comment" and "reply to this specific comment."  is a simple "reply" for both situations is less confusing?

    comment: i read up on rss.  it sounded a lot more difficult than i had thought.  you know a good tutorial?  i was eventually going to add a "what's new with my friends" thing where it lists things you subscribe to and highlights new stuff.  if i did rss, you and i would be the only ones to use it.

    comment: Maybe the top as "reply to blog" and the others are "reply to this comment" or some other such, or perhaps if they weren't done as buttons but rather as link text and more inline with in the thing it might be more indicative to me

    comment: Ohh, like there is anyone else using anything anyway, there are I believe some fairly easy RSSing of the rails woohaaa, but a view/controller/page that one could load that showed all ones friends recent changes and recent comments and recent replies to comments could be handy

    comment: couldn't resist could you?  i can't believe you spent money on something that didn't go towards the resale value of your house.  you're just throwing your money away.  it's amazing how you have any money at all with your self-control issues.  is this a reward for painting your house or something?

      Well according to my lack of sources, it doesn't look like that new one is anywhere in the system, so that gives monday at the best before purchasing does something, which then gives a week for A to kit and ship, which then means best case maybe the 21st before new rails ready boxen, unless you want to just get it over with and put it on there
    
      I would suggest darwinports, then port install ruby, then port install gems and gem install rails or something worked fairly well for me
