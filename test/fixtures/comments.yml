  comment: i was actually thinking a nice set of earphones.  although, my ears are so fucked up, i'm not sure it's wise to spend so much on something that might be useless.  maybe i'll put a down payment on an apple TV.  maybe a little NWN2.  yeah, bad idea.

    Oh I hear nwn2 blows/ed
    <br/>
    But a down payment on something else, that is how they get you, they know giving out $100 GC will really just mean people buy things for $200, $300 or more and they still make another couple hundred of the peoples. What you could do is be a pal and get with Chris & Pat and someone else and then buy me an iphone

  comment: So the adjustor guy just stopped by, passenger airbag (which deployed) alone costs $1200 (probably around the same for the driver), to replace seat belts cost $250 each (both the fronts need them), That is nearly $3000 for repairs and we haven't even gotten to the smashed hood, screwed radiator and other engine parts, fubared bumper & front quarter panel, and probable bent frame. Now I have to wait-n-see what their next call/move is

  comment: It just still doesn't do enough of what I want. After the first or second software update maybe. I mean, no copy-n-paste? No bluetooh syncing. I can't drag that cable around with me everywhere. No filesystem access I want to use that 8gb as a drive if I need to xfer files or pull out pics manually. No bluetooth network pairing. I can't tell you how many times I have been without wifi or other real internet and instead paired with my phone and used the EDGE connection then on the laptop, yes it is really slow, but in a pinch that is what you need sometimes. And no, I don't just want to use it on the phone, the laptop has a bigger screen for a reason

    Well according to my lack of sources, it doesn't look like that new one is anywhere in the system, so that gives monday at the best before purchasing does something, which then gives a week for A to kit and ship, which then means best case maybe the 21st before new rails ready boxen, unless you want to just get it over with and put it on there
    
    I would suggest darwinports, then port install ruby, then port install gems and gem install rails or something worked fairly well for me

    that is the plus and the major theory circulating, there probably won't be a new physical iphone for awhile hardware wise, instead it'll just be a series of sofware updates
    <br/>
    Which is good and bad. Good that updates would be easy, but I wonder how much OS X 2 for iphone will cost. Bad cause I would like to see GPS and and more storage in there

There are new releases of the other OSes, symbian and windows mobile, but they usually are only obtained via buying a new phone. Apple likes to pave the new way in things, so say hello to $129 for OS X 10.2 or 10.5 or what ever they started it at
