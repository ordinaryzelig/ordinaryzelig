ChecksForRecency
================



DESCRIPTION
   a model object that has_recency can be compared with a user object and return whether the model object is recent.



USAGE
   declare has_recency in model definiton.
   options:
      :time => :name_of_time_object_to_be_compared
      :user => :name_of_user_object_to_be_compared (optional)



TO DO
   has_recency should take additional block.
   this is a better way to make sure entity isn't owned by passed user.
   test whether entity has comments.  maybe this should be another plugin?
