ConsoleScriptRunner
===================



DESCRIPTION:

this is meant to allow for scripting in the console using rails code.



HOW TO USE:

just pretend you're in the console and put the code into a file.
then just type Script.run(path) in the console.
that will dynamically load the contents of the file so each time you save the file, that's what will run.
