still can't figure ot elegant way to mark things as read and not affect the parent entity nor comments.
may need to rethink it.  user.recents is doing too much.  need to figure out way of grouping.
   user.recent_entities.each do find recents (do not include recent comments)
   remove read entities
   if comment's entity is already included, remove it
   a = RecentEntityType.find_by_entity_type_id(EntityType.find_by_name('Movie').id)
   a.entity_type_id = EntityType.find_by_name('MovieRating').id
   a.save
